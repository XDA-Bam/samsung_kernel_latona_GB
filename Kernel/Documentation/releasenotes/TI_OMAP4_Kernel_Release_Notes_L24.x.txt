3.  Instructions
----------------

3.1 Board setup

Please refer to the OMAP4430 SDP guide for instructions on setting up the OMAP4
board.

3.2 Compiling Images

While building u-boot and x-loader, please note the difference in config files used for
SDP/Blaze versus Panda. For building the kernel, the config file is same for all boards.

3.2.1 Compiling U-boot

Set the environment variable PATH such that cross compile binaries point to the
needed tool chain. Refer to section 5 for tool chain information.

To select the default configuration for U-Boot type:
    For SDP and Blaze boards:
	# make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi- omap4_sdp4430_config
    For Panda boards:
	# make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi- omap4_panda_config

To build the U-Boot image type:
	# make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi-


3.2.2 Compiling X-loader (for booting from external/removable MMC/SD)

Set the environment variable PATH such that cross compile binaries point to the
needed tool chain. Refer to section 5 for tool chain information.

Please note that the restriction requiring x-loader to be in the same directory
as u-boot has been removed. Now x-loader can be built independently. You need
not even have a u-boot directory to build x-loader.

To select the default configuration for X-loader type:
    For ES1.0 SDP and Blaze boards:
	# make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi- omap4430sdp_MPU_600MHz_config
    For ES2.0 SDP and Blaze boards:
	# make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi- omap4430sdp_config
    For ES1.0 Panda boards:
	# make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi- omap4430panda_MPU_600MHz_config
    For ES2.0 Panda boards:
	# make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi- omap4430panda_config

To build the X-loader image type:
	# make ift CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi-

The above step will create a MLO image, which can be copied into the
MMC/SD card for booting via MMC/SD.

For booting from eMMC flash this MLO at sector 0x100(Address: 0x20000).
See section 3.3.2 for detailed instructions for flashing and booting
from eMMC.

3.2.4 Compiling the Kernel

Set the environment variable PATH such that cross-compile binaries point to the
needed tool chain. Refer to section 5 for tool chain information.

The default configuration file for OMAP 4430 is present at
arch/arm/configs/omap_4430sdp_defconfig.

To work with the default configuration file, run following commands:
	# make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi-
					omap_4430sdp_defconfig

For booting the kernel on OMAP4430 ES1.0, additionally enable CONFIG_OMAP4_ES1 in
the kernel config.

Build kernel with:
	# make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi- uImage

NOTE:	The above steps will create arch/arm/boot/uImage in the kernel directory
	which is the binary used for booting.


3.3 Flashing and Booting

3.3.1 Booting from removable MMC

Use the MLO (ref: section 3.2.2) and u-boot.bin (ref: section 3.2.1) binaries
and follow the instructions at http://elinux.org/BeagleBoard#MMC.2FSD_boot
to boot the board from removable MMC.

Set the board switch settings as follows to boot the board from removable MMC:
	S9 - 1-off, 2-on, 3-on, 4-on
	S8 - 1-off, 2-on, 3-off, 4-on, 5-on, 6-on, 7-on, 8-on

3.3.2 Flashing and booting from eMMC

Follow the instructions below to save x-loader and u-boot binaries to eMMC and
subsequently boot from eMMC.

Get the x-loader and u-boot binaries (that you want to flash to eMMC) into RAM
using one of the following options.

Option 1:
Use a debugger or OMAPFlasher tool to download x-loader (with configuration
header, e.g. MLO) as well as u-boot.bin into SDRAM and run u-boot from SDRAM.

Option 2:
Boot via a removable MMC card following the instructions in section 3.3.1. 
After booting from removable MMC, copy the MLO and u-boot.bin from the MMC
to RAM using the following u-boot commands:
1.	MMC initialization
		mmc rescan <device>
2.	FAT read
		fatload mmc <device> <dest-addr> <file>
3.	raw write
		mmc write <device> <src-addr> <dest-sector> <num-sectors>
Device numbers:
External SD/MMC card => MMC 1 => device = 0
eMMC				 => MMC 2 => device = 1
Number of bytes per sector: 512
All parameters should be in hex

Example flashing sequence:
	OMAP4430 SDP # mmc rescan 0
	OMAP4430 SDP # fatls mmc 0
	OMAP4430 SDP # fatload mmc 0 80000000 MLO
				reading mlo
	20104 bytes read
	OMAP4430 SDP # mmc write 1 80000000 0x100 0x28
	OMAP4430 SDP # fatload mmc 0 80000000 u-boot.bin
	reading u-boot.bin
	146652 bytes read
	OMAP4430 SDP # mmc write 1 80000000 0x400 0x11F

Please note that 0x28 above is the number of sectors in 20104
rounded up => RU(20104/512)
Similarly 0x11F is number of sectors in 146652 bytes rounded up.

Set the board switch settings as follows to boot the board from eMMC:
	S9 - 1-off, 2-on, 3-on, 4-on
	S8 - 1-on, 2-on, 3-on, 4-on, 5-on, 6-off, 7-on, 8-on

3.3.3 Using Filesystem from eMMC

Use fdisk to create an ext2 partition (/dev/mmcblk0p2) in eMMC leaving 2MB of space
at the top.

Use the following commands to flash the filesystem to eMMC partition
1) Bootup with a known good kernel and filesystem from RAM
2) Use a filesystem which has USB Gadget filestorage module g_filestorage.ko
3) Connect the usb cable from the board to the PC
4) Load the USB filestorage gadget module as:
insmod g_filestorage.ko file=/dev/mmcblk0p2 stall=0 removable=1
5) When the USB drive enumerates on the Linux PC, mount the drive
6) Add ext2 filesystem to the mounted drive
7) sync and then mount the drive.
8) Add the following in bootargs "root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw rootdelay=1" to be able
to use the eMMC based FS as rootfs.

3.3.4 Bootargs

If your board has 1GB memory, add "mem=1G" in the bootargs. Most OMAP4430
ES2.0 SDP and Blaze boards have 1GB RAM. OMAP4 ES1.0 boards have 512 MB RAM.

Since UART3 is used as the console on OMAP4 Wakeup board, you need to set
'console=ttyO2,115200n8' in the bootargs

While using a filesystem from MMC/SD/eMMC, you may use params such as:
'root=/dev/mmcblk1p2 rw rootdelay=1'. The rootdelay is required because
removable cards may take a few seconds to be detected.

On SDP and Blaze boards, eMMC block device will always be available
at /dev/mmcblk0 while removable MMC/SD block device will be available at
/dev/mmcblk1.

While using a filesystem via NFS, you may use params such as:
'root=/dev/nfs rw nfsroot=&lt;serverip&gt;:&lt;mount-partition&gt;,nolock'

Refer to section 3.4.2 for display related bootargs options

For detailed list and explaination of the various boot parameters, please refer
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/lkn/lkn_pdf/ch09.pdf


3.3.5 Saving environment variables in u-boot

The 'saveenv' command in u-boot saves the environment variables in eMMC
on OMAP4 SDP and Blaze boards. This is not supported on Panda boards as
eMMC is not available on Panda boards.

On SDP and Blaze, the environment variables  are stored on a RAW partition
of size 128KB on eMMC starting from sector 0x700 to sector 0x7FF. 

3.4 Using FB and V4L2 Display driver

For details please refer to:
http://omappedia.org/wiki/Bootargs_for_enabling_display

Write Back usage guide is available at:
http://omappedia.org/wiki/Write_Back_pipeline_usage_guide

3.5 Enabling Power Management Features

All PM features are enabled by default in OMAP4 kernel configuration
(omap_4430sdp_defconfig).
 
Note that PM features on OMAP4430 ES1.0 are not supported and hence 
all PM features are disabled once CONFIG_OMAP4_ES1 is selected.

3.5.1 CPU Hotplug

To hotplug out CPU1 use the following command

echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online

To bring back CPU1 online use the following command

echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online

Note that CPU0 cannot be offlined due to hardware limitation.
Currenlty CPU1 transitions to CSWR state when offlined. This can
only be verified using OBS signals.

3.5.2 CPUIdle

To test cpuidle, it's necessary that CPU1 is hotplugged out.
Use the below command to hotplug out CPU1
echo 0 >  /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online

Once CPU1 is hotplugged out, OBS signals can be used to
verify MPU/CPU0/CPU1 transtitions.

Currently only sleep state of MPU CSWR is supported.

3.5.3 System Suspend

To test system suspend, use the following command

echo mem > /sys/power/state

Use OBS signals to verify MPU/CPU0/CPU1 transitions.

Currently only sleep state of MPU CSWR is supported.

Please use a ramdisk inorder to test system suspend feature

3.6 Using Audio Driver

Include the asound.conf file in /etc directory in your FS. It maps the different
audio devices 

Usage:
aplay -D mm file.wav
aplay -D tones file.wav
aplay -D vx file.wav
aplay -D hd_audio file.wav
